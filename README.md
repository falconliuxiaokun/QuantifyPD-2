# QuantifyPD-2
This is part 2 that requires the excel results from quantifyPD-1

Excel
The final output of the Fiji macro is an excel file that contains data for each particle detected in each slice of each z-stack image of each sample. To proceed the analysis from here you need to refer to Matt’s guide on how to elaborate the excel file, before passing to the R analysis. Matt’s explanation is in the attached file ‘Matt excel sheet protocol’.
Once you have done what you have to do with the excel file, you can proceed with the R script

R script
The R script is a mix of Matt’s script and Anna's addition, but the most important part, the method to summarise the data, is Matt’s coding so it should be the same whatever old version of the script you have.
In the attached R script there are 4 parts:
PART 1. packages that you need to run this script
PART 2. colour palette set up that you need if you want to make plots with the colours that I like
PART 3. Matt's method of summarising and plotting the data
PART 4. Annalisa's method to plot the data following Matt's analysis
The way I do it is, Run part 1 and 2, then copy my data from excel and then proceed with part 3 and 4
